I am currently working on an assignment where the design is a big part of it.  As discussed in [my last post "position: fixed;"](http://daniel-groves.co.uk/2010/position-fixed/ "position: fixed;"),  I took inspiration for the sidebar from the Apple website, but I thought it would be a good idea to do another blog post looking into the details of the design.  

In order to complete the best possible design for this project I decided to go through the following process: 

- Search for inspiration
- Wire-framing
- Detailed design in Adobe Fireworks CS5
- Write the HTML and CSS
- Add jQuery as necessary

### Inspiration

When beginning any web project inspiration is required in order to begin designing.  For this project I actually took the majority of my inspiration from past project that I have done.  For example I took inspiration from the <a href="http://sulisconsulting.net" title="Sulis Consulting">Sulis Consulting</a> website I created.  

<img src="http://daniel-groves.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-12-at-18.43.31-550x356.png" alt="Sulis Consulting" title="Sulis Consulting" width="550" height="356" class="size-large wp-image-328" />

You can see the grey's used in the header area on Sulis Consulting are similar to those used in the sidebar on my project site.  As discussed in my last blog entry, "position: fixed;" I also took inspiration from the Apple website.

When you configure a Macintosh product on the Apple website their are a <em>lot</em> of different options.  This results in a long page where users can scroll down configuring their Mac.  Apple have conveniently made it so that the summery box (highlighted in screenshot above) follows the user down the page so that they can always see exactly how much they are spending.  

The rest of the design has come from a jumble of ideas that I really don't know the source of.  The other elements of the design have come from a mixture of things I have seen all over the web, in print and in everything else that surrounds me.  

### Wire-framing

Wire-framing tends to be the second thing that I do when designing a website.  For this project I draw 5 different wire-frames before choosing one to build a detailed design for in Fireworks.  

<img src="http://daniel-groves.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/DSC_0016-550x351.jpg" alt="Wire-framing" title="Wire-framing" width="550" height="351" class="size-large wp-image-329" />

These wireframes make it easy to experiment with different layouts and get an idea of what the site will look like when creating a mock-up in Fireworks, saving time which can be spent on the details instead to ensure the highest-quality website when finished.  

### Fireworks CS5

The key to the design process I use is the graphical mock-up that I tend to complete in my tool of choice, Adobe Fireworks.  I start designs using the 960 grid system as 960 pixels is an ideal size to fit on all modern screens, whether they are a 1200 by 800 widescreen or a 1024 by 768 iPad screen.  

<img src="http://daniel-groves.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-13-at-00.14.30-550x406.png" alt="Fireworks Mockup Details" title="Fireworks Mockup Details" width="550" height="406" class="size-large wp-image-330" />

Once complete the fireworks mock-up will create a near-identical graphic of what I will later code using HTML and CSS.  This graphic allows me to write my HTML and CSS more efficiently as I know exactly what I am aiming for, so I can write the HTML and CSS methodically which means less code, neater and code and smaller file sizes.  

### Coding

Coding is the final stage to any design.  It is important that the code, or "mark-up" is as light as possible so that is can download and execute quickly and efficiently.  Well written code should also be easy to read so that it can be added to and modified at a later date not just by myself, but also by others who may not be sued to my code-writing style.  

All in all it important that every element of the design of a website is carefully considered.  The smallest details of a design can effect the way to is later coded and how efficiently the work is complete.  The smallest detail being added or changes could result in the need to add numerous new <tt>div</tt>'s or other elements in order to take the design to where it needs to go.
