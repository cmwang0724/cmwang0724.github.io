		<h3>Writhlington Orchid Project</h3>
		
		<p>I've been working with the Writhlington Orchid Project for almost as long as I've worked with the web. The Writhington Orchid Project required a website which they could use to keep those who support the project up to date with the latest news and information.  </p>

		<p>Further, as one of the largest micro-propagation labs in the world, they needed a way to provide people with access to the vast amounts of information about the orchids they have compiled. In order to do this they needed a site that could be easily updated by any member of the project without any training. </p>

		<p>On top of this the project does several international exploration and educational trips every year. As a result they needed to be able to update the site from low-bandwidth connections on mobile devices. To provide all of this the site makes use of the WordPress platform along with some of the latest HTML5 and CSS3 techniques to ensure it is accessible on mobile devices. </p>

		<p>Thanks to the WordPress platform the team can update the site via email and mobile applications from anywhere in the world and schedule posts to go live during UK hours, when the majority of the users are online. </p>

		<h3>AppFlow</h3>
		
		<p>AppFlow was a website to help Mac users optimise their workflow by taking advantage of third party applications as well as built in applications. Due to other commitments I recently decided to close this project down, despite it's recent redesign. </p>

		<p>The new design for AppFlow was designed to put content first and to make it as easy as possible for users to navigate around the site. The branding was also refreshed to give it a much cleaner and more modern feeling look. </p>

			<h3>Human Computer Interaction Work</h3>

			<p>Human Computer Interaction is a university module which focuses primarily on usability, ensuring that all of all ages and abilities can use systems with no training. For this module I had to design a new navigational station for an airport which could be used in a similar way to the current touch-enabled electronic information points. </p>

			<h3>Design Processes</h3>

			<p>Design Processes was a second year university module that looked at how to go about design. For the module the brief was to build a simple game using a platform such as <a href="http://www.stencyl.com" title="Stencyl Game Maker">Stencyl</a> and document the design process as we went.  We'd then be marked on a mixture of the documentation for our design process and the final game. </p>
