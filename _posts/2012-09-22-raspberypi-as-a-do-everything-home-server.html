excerpt: An initial insight into what I intend to do with my RadpberryPi computer.

<p>The RaspberryPi has caused quite a stir among the IT crowd since we first heard of its development a few years back. I was still at school when I first heard about the project, and am now in my third year of university. That's makes it at least four years ago. </p>
<p>I ordered my one as soon as they came out, but failed to get in on the first batch of 10,000. Those all sold out within minutes from both suppliers. A few months ago I finally got my Pi, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of it. I loaded it with the latest release of Raspbian (only just out at the time) and, after having no internet until a couple of days ago, am finally ready to embark on my plans for it. </p>
<p>My objectives with it are primarily:</p>
<ol><li>To have it serve an external hard drive on the network which can be used for Time Machine backups from my MacBook. 
</li><li>To offer networked media storage for iTunes that is wirelessly accessible. I really need to get all the films off my MacBook. 
</li><li>To have it automatically keep a synchronised mirror of my VPS I got a few months back; I don't have any hosting provided backup service now. 
</li><li>To keep an up-to-date clone of all of my GitHub Repositories, public and private, just in case something happens to GitHub. This will also give me somewhere to fork from if GitHub is down. 
</li><li><strong>Dependant on the device performance at this stage</strong> I would like to also have a copy of <a href="http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp" title="http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp ">Subsonic</a> running. This would allow me to stream music/films wirelessly to my iPad without having my MacBook running. 
</li></ol>
<p>The first two phases of this are already in place and were relatively easy to setup. I wrote about setting up a <a href="http://danielgroves.net/2012/01/afp-goodness-between-os-x-lion-and-ubuntu-11-10/" title="Set up a Linux based time machine server">Linux time machine server</a> some time ago, and while a little outdated now you should be able to figure it out using it. I will update it at some point soon though. </p>
<p>The iTunes drive is just an AFP share, created in exactly the same way, just without the time machine flags. I will also write about this soon if it proves to be stable. </p>
<p>I am currently working in a bash script which makes use of SSH and rsync to synchronise my VPS to a folder on the external drive. Once this works I will upload it to GitHub and, like the others, write about it. </p>
<p>For number four I have potentially sourced a nice little Ruby script that I can set-up as a cron job to do exactly what I'm after. Ruby is compiling on the Pi as I type and if it works as I hope I will provide a link to it and instructions for anything different that I had to do to get it working. I might even translate it into a Bash script so it'll run on a Pi out of the box ((I know it doesn't literally run out of the box, but it would run on just about any Linux install without any extra packages this way)). </p>
<p>For the final objective I am hoping to make use of <a href="http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp" title="http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp ">Subsonic</a>. This package advertises a full web interface for for music and video control as well the ability to stream to iTunes and the iOS Music/Video applications. </p>
<p>If anyone has already done anything above, whether on a Pi or any other Linux machine it would be great to hear from you with your experiences and how you went about it in the comments below. </p>
<p>What do you plan on doing with your RaspberryPi?</p>
