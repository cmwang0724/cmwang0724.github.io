title: RaspberryPi Server Update rSync and Subsonic
date: 2012-10-15 18:37:05.000000000 +01:00
excerpt: An update into what I have been doing with my RaspberryPi; rSync for web server backups and a SubSonic media server. 
---
<p>A few weeks back I wrote about my intentions with my RaspberryPi. These came as five 'phases'.</p>

<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li>To have it serve an external hard drive on the network which can be used for Time Machine backups from my MacBook.</li>
		<li>To offer networked media storage for iTunes that is wirelessly accessible. I really need to get all the films off my MacBook.</li>
		<li>To have it automatically keep a synchronised mirror of my VPS I got a few months back; I don't have any hosting provided backup service now.</li>
		<li>To keep an up-to-date clone of all of my GitHub Repositories, public and private, just in case something happens to GitHub. This will also give me somewhere to fork from if GitHub is down.</li>
		<li><strong>Dependant on the device performance at this stage</strong> I would like to also have a copy of SubSonic running. This would allow me to stream music/films wirelessly to my iPad without having my MacBook running.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I think at this stage it is safe to say that the priority of each of these has changed somewhat, reducing my plans down to just four phases.</p>

<ol>
	<li>To have it serve an external hard drive on the network which can be used for Time Machine backups.</li>
	<li>To have it automatically keep a synchronised mirror of my VPS; I don't have any hosting provided backup service anymore.</li>
	<li>To keep an up-to-date clone of all of my GitHub Repositories, public and private, just in case. This will also give me somewhere to fork from if GitHub is down.</li>
	<li>I would like to also have a copy of SubSonic running. This would allow me to stream music/films wirelessly to my iPad without having my MacBook running. [<em>This now completely replaces the initial phase two as this will require media offloading anyway.</em>]</li>
</ol>

<h3>Phase Two: VPS Backup</h3>

<p>Over the last couple of days I have begun work on using Rsync to backup the VPS to an external hard drive on my RaspberryPi. So far I have reached a stage where I can mostly download everything via Rsync to my RaspberryPi, although the Rsync task always fails when it reaches ```/var/www``` on the remote server.</p>

<p>Once this is working I will copy the command into a shell script and schedule this to run daily with cron. I then intend to compress the content of the backup into a ```.tar.gz``` archive to store for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Archiving this backup for a few weeks, should a disaster strike, will allow me to restore my server days after the disaster occurs. I am often away for days at a time and won't necessarily be able to do anything about any problems for 48-hours after. If I simply allowed Rsync to run without archiving the download elsewhere Rsync would simply overwrite the existing backup and I would loose the last known working copy.</p>

<p>Currently my command doesn't work quite as intended, but I am working on diagnosing the current issues now.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
rsync -arv --delete --exclude=/dev --exclude=/sys --exclude=/proc --exclude=/tmp user@danielgroves.net:/ /media/Tardis/vps/
{% endhighlight %}

<p>When finished I intend to use <a title="Setup a keychain on a linux system" href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ssh-passwordless-login-with-keychain-for-scripts/ ">`keychain`</a> to store the passphrase for a unique SSH key pair which has been created purely for any interactions between my VPS and RaspberryPi. This means that should the SD card for the RaspberryPi get lost, stolen or otherwise compromised I can easily disable access to my server from the RaspberryPi.</p>

<h3>SubSonic</h3>

<p>Last night I also found time to install SubSonic onto the RaspberyPi. SubSonic runs on Java, which runs fine on an ARM chip, so this was a pretty straight foreword process. To install SubSonic all that I had to do was download the latest release from the SubSonic website and then run:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo dpkg -i subsonic-x-x-x.deb
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This installed and ran SubSonic for the first time without any issues.</p>

<p>By pointing my browser to the RaspberryPi' IP address and appending it with the port ```4040``` (```:4040```), as specified in the SubSonic documentation, I was presented with a login screen.</p>

<p>The default username and password could have been presented more clearly; these are 'admin' and 'admin'. As I logged in a navigated around the admin panel I did find the web UI to be very slow at responding. It's noticeably faster with JavaScript off, but not fully functional. It really is required to use it effectively.</p>

<p>The first step that the introduction screen asks you to do is follow a link and change the default password. Doing this seemed to crash SubSonic, so I flipped back over to my SSH connection and restarted the process.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
sudo service subsonic restart
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This allowed me to connect to the server once again, but I was presented with an error instead of the login screen again; and that's where I left off for the night.</p>

<h3>Where Next?</h3>

<p>My main focus with the RaspberryPi at the moment will be to get the Rsync backup of my VPS fully working. This is the most important task for the Pi to perform, as it will be a crucial resource in the event my VPS gets compromised in the future, or taken down for some other reason.</p>

<p>The first phase, Time Machine backups, is already working in full. I hope to do a write up in the near future when time presents itself explaining whats changed since my last post on the topic as Mountain Lion requires further tweaks in the Linux setup to work over a network, although these changes are fairly minor on this occasion.</p>

<p>The least important fix will be to get SubSonic running. This isn't vital so it'll probably wait, I might not even bother with this at all now as I am considering the purchase of an iMac in the near future to take over the workhorse role from my MacBook.</p>
