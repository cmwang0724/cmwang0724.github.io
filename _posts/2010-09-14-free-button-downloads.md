This morning I was playing in Photoshop, trying to get used to designing in it again, as for a long time now I have been using Fireworks.  So, I have create two clean and minimal buttons, one for uploading files and the other for downloads.  

<img src="http://danielgroves.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/upload.png" alt="Upload Button" title="Upload Button" width="300" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-313" />

<img src="http://danielgroves.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/download.png" alt="Download Button" title="Download Button" width="300" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-314" />

Over at [Forrst](http://forrst.com/people/danielgroves/) I promised that I would make them available for download for anyone who wants them.  Before downloading I want to make the following clear, by downloading them you are agreeing to these terms:

<strong>You Must</strong>

- Post a link to where they are in use in the comment section below

<strong>I would like it if you:</strong>

- Link back to this page so others know where to find the buttons

<strong>You Can:</strong>

- Use these freely on any non-profit project or webpage
- Modify the download

<strong>You Cannot:</strong>

- Distribute these icons
- Use these icons without written permission from me on a profitable website.  This includes product sales, advertising revenue, or business promotion

### Download &amp; Conclusion

Anyway, thats the boring bit over, so if you agree, feel free to [download](http://forrst.com/people/danielgroves/) the buttons (The reason I'm not using these buttons here is as to not create confusion, and because I have something a little different under production).

What do you think of them?  Any tips?  Please leave them in the comment below.
