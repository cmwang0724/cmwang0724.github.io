Several people have been asking what settings I am using in order to create my [Alfred App](http://www.alfredapp.com/ "Alfred - Your Mac's personal butler") colour scheme, so following the screen shot are all of my settings.

First off, it's based on the default theme "Dark", changing this at the start will save you from having to change a few of the colours.

And now, here's comes my settings.
