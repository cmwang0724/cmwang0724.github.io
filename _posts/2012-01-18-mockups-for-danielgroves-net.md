A friend of mine is currently trying to improve his skills when designing UIs for the web, and asked to see the initial UI mockups that I created for this site.  

So, without further udo I have decided to publish the original images here for all to see.  All of the these designs were completed in Adobe Fireworks CS5 for Mac.

Those are the actual mockups I used when creating the homepage and the portfolio page.  The homepage designs were posted on [Forrst](http://forr.st/~Ngt "Forrst post for the designs") for those who have an account.
